:body: Game of Thrones is an awesome show but there are too 
many characters to remember.
We even did not see half of the families and still at least 20 
important characters are introduced already.
Is there anyplace that I can read about the characters?

:body: Well the book is one hell of a resource.
And, the script is written very loyal to the text.
